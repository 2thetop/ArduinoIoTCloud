# ArduinoIoTCloud

This library allows to connect to the Arduino IoT Cloud service. It provides a ConnectionManager to handle connection/disconnection, property-change updates and events callbacks.
The supported boards are MKRGSM, MKR1000 (Wifi101) and MKR 1010 (WifiNINA).

## Arduino IoT Cloud

[Arduino IoT Cloud](https://create.arduino.cc/iot/things) is a service which allows connecting the cloud to the world around you. [Here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/IoT/HomePage) an introduction.
Now the platform is in public beta, feedbacks are welcome.


### Arduino IoT Cloud Components

- **Devices**: Physical objects like a hardware board (e.g. MKR WiFi 1010). This is the hardware which runs the software, read sensors, controls actuators and comunicates with the Arduino IoT Cloud.

- **Things**: Logical representation of a connected object. They represent the inherent properties of the object, with as little reference to the actual hardware used to implement them. Each thing is represented by a collection of properties (e.g., temperature, light).

- **Properties**: Qualities defining the characteristics of a system. A property can be something like a read-only (RO) setting to indicate the Arduino IoT Cloud can read the data, but cannot change the value of the property. A property might be designed as read and write (RW) if the Arduino IoT Cloud can also remotely change the propertyâ€™s value and send an event notification to the device.

- **Events**: When something happens the Arduino IoT Cloud is aware of it thanks to  application messages. For example, it might be informed by a face-recognition application that someone is at a door, or it has received a request from another app that a light be turned on.

- **Software**: It's quickly autogenerated automatically by the Arduino IoT Cloud when setting up a new thing: in this way everything that you need it's almost done and ready. The connection to the cloud it's already made possible by this library. You have only to implement the callbacks linked to the properties.

## ArduinoIoTCloud library

The library is divided in various classes:
- `ConnectionManager` which is responsable for the connection to the internet and to the Arduino IoT Cloud through `WiFiConnectionManager` or `GSMConnectionManager`. The selection is done using the type of board used.

- `ArduinoIoTCloud` it's the leading class. It's responsable for the connection to the MQTT Broker.

- `CloudSerial` it's similar to [Serial](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/), but it's used in combination with the cloud.
